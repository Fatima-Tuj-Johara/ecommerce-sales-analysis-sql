# What I Found in the Data

## Quick Summary

I analyzed e-commerce sales data to understand customer behavior and business performance. Here's what stood out.

---

## 1. Revenue Breakdown

**What I looked at:**
- Total sales by product category
- Which regions bring in the most money
- Monthly trends

**What I found:**
- Electronics makes up the biggest chunk of revenue
- North America is our strongest region
- Sales grew steadily through most months

**My take:**
We're doing well in electronics, but other categories have room to grow. Maybe we should focus more marketing on underperforming categories.

## 2. Customer Insights

**What I checked:**
- Top spending customers
- How many customers come back
- Customer value segments

**What I found:**
- Top 10 customers contribute a big portion of revenue
- Not many repeat customers (most people only order once)
- About 30% of customers are "high value" (spent over $1000)

**My thoughts:**
We need to work on getting customers to come back. Maybe loyalty rewards or email campaigns for past customers?

## 3. Discount Strategy

**What I tested:**
- Revenue at different discount levels
- Average order value with vs without discounts
- Customer ratings by discount amount

**What surprised me:**
- Orders with NO discount actually have higher average values
- 20% discounts get more orders but lower profit per order
- Discounts don't really affect ratings that much

**What this means:**
We might be giving too many discounts. Could test offering smaller discounts (5-10%) or only to new customers.

## 4. Delivery & Operations

**What I measured:**
- Average delivery time by region
- Late deliveries (over 7 days)
- How delivery affects ratings

**Big issues I found:**
- Some regions average 9+ days for delivery
- Late deliveries = lower ratings (obvious but the data proves it)
- About 15% of orders are "late"

---

## 5. Product Returns

**What I analyzed:**
- Return rate overall
- Which categories get returned most
- Relationship between ratings and returns

**Key points:**
- Overall return rate is around 8%
- Certain categories have way higher returns (like clothing at 12%)
- Products with lower ratings get returned more
